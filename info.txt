- Check the Ship class for proper documentation
- I used modular programming in the Asteroid, AsteroidSmall, AsteroidMedium, and AsteroidBig classes where Asteroid was the superclass 
and AsteroidSmall, AsteroidMedium, and AsteroidBig were the subclasses
- I used AGILE in the sprint interviews and the worklog, in which I continuosly laid out goals for each sprint and began to build the game out from scratch
- I used JavaFX, and installation mostly depends on the IDE.
For VSCode, install the Java extension and also install the JavaFX package from online
